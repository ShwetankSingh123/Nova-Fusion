NOVA FUSION is an innovative online platform that merges the art marketplace with interactive gaming elements to engage a younger audience. Built using React for the website and Unity for the integrated game, NOVA FUSION allows users to explore and purchase affordable art while participating in gamified challenges to earn rewards. This unique combination enhances user engagement, promotes emerging artists, and democratizes the art purchasing process. The platformâ€™s intuitive design and immersive experience reflect my skills in web development, game design, and user experience optimization.
